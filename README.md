With the help of this kali linux image, you can easily access PEzor on your system! 

Basically, this image is built from the kalilinux/kali-rolling image and then the PEzor shellcode and PE packer is installed on top of it. Sometimes, it's vital to have access to PEzor, specially in a post exploit phase, but installing it on a host or a VM is a time-consuming task due to the dependencies that are required. Having said that, this docker image is created to solve this problem and provide a quick way to access PEzor.
